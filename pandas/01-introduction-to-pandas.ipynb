It might have:\n- Inconsistent column names or types  \n- Missing or duplicate entries  \n- Extra spaces, special characters, or incorrect values  \n\nPandas is especially powerful for data munging and wrangling tasks.  \nIt provides simple methods to:\n- Filter and sort data  \n- Fill or drop missing values  \n- Merge and join multiple datasets  \n- Convert data types  \n- Group and aggregate records  \n\n### Example:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load a dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Preview the first few rows\ndf.head()\n\n# Drop missing values\ndf_clean = df.dropna()\n\n# Convert a column to a consistent type\ndf_clean[\"price\"] = df_clean[\"price\"].astype(float)\n\n# Check the cleaned data\ndf_clean.info()\n","metadata":{}}]}
